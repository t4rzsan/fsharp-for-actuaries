    "The easiest way for you to read data from a CSV file is to use the F# [CSV type provider](https://fsharp.github.io/FSharp.Data/library/CsvProvider.html).  The type provider reads the file and automatically generates types based on the columns in the file, which makes it very easy for you to handle the data."
