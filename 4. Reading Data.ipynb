    "# Reading Data\n",

    "\n",
    "## Reading from CSV files\n",
    "The easiest way for you to read data from a CSV file is to use the F# [CSV type provider](https://fsharp.github.io/FSharp.Data/library/CsvProvider.html).  The type provider reads the file and automatically generates types based on the columns in the file, which makes it very easy for you to handle the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "I have created a [sample file](Policies.csv) looking like this.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "PersonId;PolicyNumber;Age;Gender;Premium;TechnicalProvision\n",
    "1;Pol001;55;m;100;1233,54\n",
    "1;Pol002;55;m;150;264,23\n",
    "2;Pol003;32;f;125;5465,32\n",
    "2;Pol004;32;f;300;475,23\n",
    "3;Pol005;20;m;400;234\n",
    "4;Pol006;64;f;167;5343,64\n",
    "```\n",
    "As you can see, the file is actually semicolon-separated and the amounts use a comma as decimal-separator (Scandinavian-style).  The CSV type provider lets you configure a lot of things like the separator and the culture (country). You can create the type provider in two ways: Either by using a file as template or by defining the columns manually.  In the first case, the provider will try and guess the type for each column based on the data for that column.  If the provider guesses wrong, you can override the type of each column.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us see how that works."
