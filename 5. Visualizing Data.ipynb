    "They say that a picture is worth a thousand words and often looking at data in a chart reveals a whole lot more than by merely looking at numbers in a table.  In the previous examples you have already seen how easy it is to draw charts in F#.  We did that with the [XPlot](https://fslab.org/XPlot/) library (which is built into Jupyter Notebook).  XPlot is a F# friendly wrapper on top of [Google Plots](https://fslab.org/XPlot/google-charts.html) and [Plotly](https://fslab.org/XPlot/plotly.html).  "
